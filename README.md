# COL (Operations Research codes)

## List of codes

1. Simplex method (C++)  
    - Maximization problem
2. Duality theory (C++)  
    - Create dual of a given simplex problem
3. Transportation problem  
    - Uses Vogel's approximation method and Least cost method
    - Least cost is default mode of solving
    - User can prompt for Vogel's approximation method to solve the problem
4. Assignment problem
    - Hungarian method to solve assignment problem
5. Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall
    - Dijkstra's algorihtm for single-source shortest path
    - Floyd-Warshall's algorithm for all-pairs shortest path
6. Ford-Fulkerson
    - Ford-Fulkerson maximum flow problem
7. 0/1 Knapsack using Dynamic programming
